                    To give players potion effects use the `<potion>` module in a kit and apply it to players when they spawn or enter a region.

                        <potion duration="10" amplifier="4">damage resistance</potion>
                        <potion duration="900" amplifier="1" ambient="true">jump</potion>

                    Potions effects will be applied directly to the player. Duration specifies how long the potion will last in seconds and amplifier what level / how strong the potion is. The potion type is specified using the [potion name](/reference/potion_effects).

                    `NOTE:` Infinite duration can be specified by using `oo` as the duration.

                    Specifing `ambient="true"` will increase the amount of particles a player emits and make the particles translucent.

                    To give a potion as an item you have to use:

                        <item slot="3" damage="8229">potion</item>

                    The damage specifies the potion type. [Minecraft wiki - Potions](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Potions).

                    Alternitively, you can give custom potions by using `potions="potion type:ticks:potency:ambient value"`. The potion type can be found on the [Minecraft wiki - Potions](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Potions). The ambient value can only be `true` or `false`.

                    `NOTE:` There are 20 ticks to one second.

                    This will give you a potion with a base effect, potency, and duration as well as a fire resistance effect:

                        <item slot="3" damage="8229" potions="fire resistance:900:0:false">potion</item>
